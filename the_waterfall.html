                <p>With what deep murmurs through time’s silent stealth</p>
                <p>Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat’ry wealth</p>
                <p>Here flowing fall,</p>
                <p>And chide, and call,</p>
                <p>As if his liquid, loose retinue stay’d</p>
                <p>Ling’ring, and were of this steep place afraid;</p>
                <p>The common pass</p>
                <p>Where, clear as glass,</p>
                <p>All must descend</p>
                <p>Not to an end,</p>
                <p>But quicken’d by this deep and rocky grave,</p>
                <p>Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.</p>

            <div class="stanza2">
                <p>Dear stream! dear bank, where often I</p>
                <p>Have sate and pleas’d my pensive eye,</p>
                <p>Why, since each drop of thy quick store</p>
                <p>Runs thither whence it flow’d before,</p>
                <p>Should poor souls fear a shade or night,</p>
                <p>Who came, sure, from a sea of light?</p>
                <p>Or since those drops are all sent back</p>
                <p>So sure to thee, that none doth lack,</p>
                <p>Why should frail flesh doubt any more</p>
                <p>That what God takes, he’ll not restore?</p>

                <p>O useful element and clear!</p>
                <p>My sacred wash and cleanser here,</p>
                <p>My first consigner unto those</p>
                <p>Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!</p>
                <p>What sublime truths and wholesome themes</p>
                <p>Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!</p>
                <p>Such as dull man can never find</p>
                <p>Unless that Spirit lead his mind</p>
                <p>Which first upon thy face did move,</p>
                <p>And hatch’d all with his quick’ning love.</p>
                <p>As this loud brook’s incessant fall</p>
                <p>In streaming rings restagnates all,</p>
                <p>Which reach by course the bank, and then</p>
                <p>Are no more seen, just so pass men.</p>
                <p>O my invisible estate,</p>
                <p>My glorious liberty, still late!</p>
                <p>Thou art the channel my soul seeks,</p>
                <p>Not this with cataracts and creeks.</p>
